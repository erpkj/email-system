<p> When I was a boy, a friend of mine in a moment of rage mockingly told me: "You are a DREAMER!". In spite of the taunting voice tone, these words sounded good to me. In fact, I always aim to do something to make this a better world, even in the little, meaningless details of everyday life. Later I found that design, music and art in general can be a truly mean to share a vision and live a better life and maybe to help others to live better too.</p>
